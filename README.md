Verilog Digital Logic and Computer Architecture Repository

Overview

Welcome to the Verilog Digital Logic and Computer Architecture repository! This project is dedicated to creating a comprehensive collection of Verilog modules for:
Digital logic circuits
Microprocessor components
Computer architecture systems
Each module is accompanied by a robust test bench to verify its functionality, ensuring high-quality and reliable designs.
